>Description: The code is an pytorch implementation of [《Retinal Vessel Segmentation in Fundoscopic Images with Generative Adversarial Networks》](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09318)

## Overview

### Data

[DRIVE: Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction](http://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/) you can download the train and test data from this server. You can also find data in the eyedata folder.

### Pre-processing

The dataset contains 20 training images, the first step of my pre-processing is randomly cropping into 512*512. The second step is to randomly change brightness ,contrast and hue of the train image. I implement this method in my code, so that it may be convenient to use. Furthermore, a gan-based method of generating retina images can be used as an extra data source. 

### Model
